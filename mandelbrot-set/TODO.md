## Mandelbrot TODO:
* Figure out a way to make it faster;
* Watch Coding Train video and compare to his version for improvements:
    - <del>In the video he doesn't make a matrix. He just colors the pixels straight away</del>;
    - <del>Also, he doesn't use *draw* function, he does everything from *setup*</del>;
    - <del>look into the map function he uses (is it p5 or vanilla js?)</del>;
        - It's a p5 function.
* Try to make it "zoomable";
